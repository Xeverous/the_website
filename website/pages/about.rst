I knew I had something of a teacher in me for quite some time. During my first non-mandatory education path (which could be translated as "technical school") I picked up programming somewhere on the second or third year and quickly realized that C++ is the language I want to work with (especially because of its philosophy).

I have been helping many people (mostly in my classroom) but soon simply due to the size of knowledge I offered I started amassing various programming-related materials. There was no significant form, just more or less organized notes I could paste examples and explanations from for people that asked me for help. There was an idea for a small wiki or something similar so that others could see my materials in a more organized manner but it was never realized apart from few pages of selectively choosen and concentrated knowledge.

I the university days, I met new people (and some from previous school) and quickly realized I will be doing similar things again. But I had much more materials this time. Eventually someone asked me why not just publish them somewhere online. Initially the idea was to improve learncpp.com which (at that time and probably still now) was/is the best free online C++ tutorial.

I found numerous mistakes within the website and also many missing topics - stuff I thought was worthwhile to cover. Some topics (mostly about templates) weren't covered at all. I wrote to Alex (the person behind learncpp.com) and asked about potential cooperation to improve existing articles and proposed some new ones (that I could write). He rejected, giving me multiple reasons, some technical, some personal.

Around at that time, github started offering a new service: *github pages*. Free hosting of static websites (no backend: no database, server-generated pages, logging etc.), just HTML, CSS and JS. A colleague proposed: *Why you just don't make a website of your own?* It turned out that after github released this service, numerous frameworks for generating static websites started to appear.

The story of this website build process is a long one, worthy of a separate article. In short, I tried multiple frameworks and learned a lot about Python and web technologies in the process. This website build process will very likely still continue to evolve.
