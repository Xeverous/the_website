The tutorial is aimed at teaching you the C++ programming language. Core goals:

- Understanding concepts that are ubiquitous in the programming world (e.g. objects, conditional instructions, loops, algorithms, function call stack and many more).
- Teaching you things that go with proper programming: making decisions, solving problems, good/bad habits, programming style...
- Understanding what differentiates C++ from other programming languages (features, syntax, conventions, ...).

Other notes:

- This chapther was (and still is) one of the hardest ones to write. If you managed to setup the environment so that you can write code and run it, you have already accomplished a significant step.
- Don't copy-paste code samples until you memorize the grammar. It's obvious that at the start you will not remember perfectly where every punctuation goes. Just by rewriting examples you will learn it over time.
- If at any point you encounter a term that you don't know the meaning of, check the `glossary <link://filename/pages/cpp/utility/glossary.md>`_.
- If you ever have an urge to edit example code and see what happens - do it. You will learn a lot through experience. If you encounter a non-trivial problem - don't put too much effort into it - there are tons of things you might not know at the beginning but will know later. Take notes of these problems and attempt to solve them later when you know more.

    What if I can't understand something?

You can always research the topic on your own, but more often than not you can simply move on. Usually the fun part comes when you can mix A3 with C1, but the lessons will teach you A, B, C then 1, 2, 3. Some will only get it on 6th lesson with A1 example, then move back and reread content that was previosly unclear. In other words, sometimes you may need to move through unclear lessons about A, B, C, understand the topic during lessons about 1, 2, 3 and then move back to A, B, C when you got it during A1/A2/A3 examples. Sometimes you just need to gather enough building blocks untill it starts making sense. Patience is highly valuable in beginners.

Take notes during learning and if you feel like you can provide some feedback (especially on the order of lessons) - do it. TODO link.

    Do I need to spend any money to learn through this site?

Absolutely not. The whole website is a hobby-made open-source project and as someone who strongly supports FOSS (free and open-source software), all of tools recommended by me will be FOSS. C++ is a programming language which is not owned by any company (it's standarized by `ISO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization>`_) and as it's ancestor (the C programming language) it receives significant support from open-source community.

    Do I need to be good in math to program?

In my opinion, it's enough to understand functions and polynomial equations. By understanding I don't mean knowing how to draw and solve every equation, but to get the concept. Function as a term appears very frequently in programming but it doesn't represent mathematical functions, it's more of a concept of reusable mechanism that accepts certain input and provides certain output. Any math beyond that is not required. We program so that we are not bothered with math, this is the task for computers. Still, any additional knowledge will be beneficial - especially mathematical logic.

    Do I need to understand the binary system?

It is not required, but it is an advantage. Except few operations, nothing really depends on understanding binary system - all programming languages abstract binary system unless you want to perform binary-level operations.

    Do I need to be good in English?

I don't think my english is particulary hard (I'm not a native speaker by the way) but I encourage you to learn English (before or during the course) if you have problems reading the content. English is the main language of IT industry so even if you somehow learned programming without speaking English, chances of getting a job are significantly lower.

    Do I need a powerful computer to program?

No. The essential part of programming is reading and writing code. I hardly doubt your computer is not capable of launching a text editor. If you can view this website, you can program too.
