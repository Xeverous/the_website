Note: if you are reporting a "typo" of the code presented on the website and it has an impact at the programming language level (mistakes like T& vs T&&, + vs -) OR it causes the code to not compile - use the "incorrect content" issue template instead.

___

**Where are the typo(s):**

- provide link to respective article (and potentially text fragment for ctr+F)
- you may provide a permalink to the source as explained here: https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet
- for mass typos: grep/awk/sed command that reproduces or fixes all of them
